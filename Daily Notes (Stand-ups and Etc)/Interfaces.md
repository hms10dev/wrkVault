# Types of Interfaces

## Marker Interface

- Without Methods


## SAM (Single Abstract Method)

- Functional Interface
- 
    

## NORMAL

- study of graphs began in 17366, Leonhard Euler's Sever Bridges of Konisberg
    - study: find a path that would cross every bridge only once
    - no such path could be found

### SubSubject

- four-color theorem
- GPS/maps

### SubSubject 2

- Social networks, such as facebook, twitter, and instagram
- gene/protein expression networks

## Equation Example:

$$
G = (V,E)
$$

- n vertices V ((nodes))
- m edges E (links)
- all elements are unique, aka **no repeated values**
- each edge is defined by its starting and ending edges.
    - ex: (a,b)

# REVIEW :

# Vocab:

- **undirected** graph
    
    $e =(u,v)∈ E ⇒ (v,u)∈ E$
    
    in other words, its possible to go from u to v, and vice versa
    
- **directed** graph
    
    it is not possible to go from u to v and vice versa
    
    so the 
    
    $e =(u,v)∈ E ⇒ (v,u)∈ E$
    
    equation does not hold..
    
- self loop
    
    the starting and ending vertices are the same 
    
    i.e. e=(v,v))
    
- path
    
    A path is a sequence of vertices (v1,v2,...,vk), such that vi+1 is a neighbor of vi .

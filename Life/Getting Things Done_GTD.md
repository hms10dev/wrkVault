>A popular task management system created by productivity consultant David Allen, The methodology is based on a simple truth: The more information bouncing around inside your head, the harder it is to decide what needs attention. 
>As a result, you spend more time thinking about your tasks than actually doing them. 
>When information piles up in your head, it leads to:
> 	- stress, 
> 	- overwhelm,
> 	- and uncertainty.

- Allen observed that brains are really good at processing information, but not storing it. 
- GTD  lays out how to dump out all the mental clutter.

>Some very specific but seemingly mundane behaviors, when applied, produce the capacity to exist in a kind of sophisticated spontaneity, which, in my experience, is a key element to a successful life.
>— David Allen


## Capture

- stop storing info in brain.
- anything that crosses the mind, must be captured immediately and stored in an inbox. 
	- to-dos, events, ideas, book recs, 
- Inbox is used to collect chaos of thoughts in order to get them off the  mind.
- a physical representation of all the inputs you need to somehow deal with on a daily basis

> In Todoist, your inbox will act as the default place to hold all your inputs until you have a chance to organize them. To add a new task to your Inbox in the web or desktop apps, click the plus sign in the right corner or simply press “q.” The task will be added to the Inbox by default unless you otherwise specify a project.


### Do an initial mindsweep. 
- full mindsweep of all the 'open loops' you can think of 
	- anything you may have to take action on in the future.
	- consult the [trigger list](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf) to help jog your memory.

### Capture new tasks right away.
- core tenant of GTD: get tasks out of your head, and into the external system  **the moment** they come to you. 
- when a new tasks comes to mind, make it a habit to immediatlely add it to the 'inbox', and worry about organizing it later. 
- ==Install apps on the following:==
	- Computer
	- phone
	- extention for web browser
	- plugin for email client
### Consolidate inboxes
#### Capture reading and reference material:
- Take photos of business cards or event reminders and attach them to the relevant task’s comments. 
- Attacher files from Dropbox, Google Drive, or your computer to any task 📌 lire or work on later.
- Connect a reading app like Pocket with Todoist via our IFTTT integration and have a Todoist task automatically created every time you add an article to Pocket.
- Download Todoist for Chrome, Safari, or Firefox to save any url to access later.Use the Todoist share extensions on Android or iOS to share pages from mobile apps as tâches.

## Clarify :

The inbox is full. now we need to transform the chaotic clutter of everything that was collected into concrete action steps. 
_Go through each item and do one of the following:_
- If the item will take less than 2 minutes, complete it right away.
- If it can be delegated, assign the task to someone else.
- If it's a non-actionable reference item (eg, a file, document, article, contact information etc.) that you'll need to come back to later, file it away in a separate reference project or attach it to the comments of the relevant task or project.
- If the item needs to be done at a specific date and/or time, give the task a [due date](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205325931?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides).
- If the task is no longer needed or actionable, delete it.
- If a task requires more than one step, create a project to house all of the items associated with it and identify the one next action you can take to move the project forward.![GTD Todoist Flowchart](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/34yMizMouqByy6srPWh9Y/67cabb8d086008c543fcbf01ed6d0cca/GTD_Todoist_Flowchart.jpg)
- Make tasks and specific and actionable as possible. 
	- Add as much information as you can to save you time puzzling over it later. 
	- For example, “Call Mom” may actually need to be entered as “Call Mom to discuss birthday dinner.” 
	- Or, "Taxes" could be "Call Mary to discuss tax documents" 
		- with Mary's phone number and a list of the specific documents attached in the task’s comments 

![GTD Bad-vs-Good-To-Do-List](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/61rN3XzxFMeb9O87neWeR5/bd984163107d8e48c7f818be8e0bcb8b/Bad-vs-Good-To-Do-List.jpg)

## Organize
It's time to sort the items in  the appropriate place.

### One-off tasks:
	take longer than 2 minutes but only require one step.
	ex: "Replay to James' email about project pricing"
	or 'renew car tags'
#### How to implement in todoist:
-   [Create a new project](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/360000188965-Create-a-project?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) called _One-Off Tasks._

-   Drag and drop your one-step tasks from the inbox to this project by clicking on the grey "handle" to the left of the task name and dragging it to the project name in the left-hand menu.

-   You can also designate a different project by typing "#" into the task field to pull up a list of all your projects. Select your project from the list or keep typing the project name to narrow down the results.

### Projects:
Many of the tasks are actually 'projects'.
Project: any item that requires more than two steps to complete
	- ex: paint the bedroom
#### How to implement in todoist:
-   Create a new project for each multi-step project you identified as you were clarifying your tasks.

-   Drag and drop the associated tasks from your Inbox to the appropriate project. Or click on a task and type "#" into the task field to pull up a list of your projects to choose from.

-   As you think of other steps, add them as new tasks inside the projects.

### Areas of focus
- GTD term for various areas of responsibility in your life.
- These are a tool to draw attention to broader life goals. 
- ==If a task does not fit within the scope of any of your areas of focus, it may be time to reassess if it's something you want to spend your time on.==
	- or, you can seperate projects between work and personal
#### How to implement in todoist:
1.  Create a project for each area of focus. This project won’t have any tasks in it, it’s just for visual organization.
    
2.  Click on the grey handle to the left of the project name and drag and indent your actual projects underneath the high-level “Folders” you just created to turn them into sub-projects.
    
3.  (Optional) To create even more visual separation between your areas of focus, assign a different project color for each area.
- Now you’ll be able to keep your project list clean by collapsing your sub-projects underneath the parent project. For example, while you're at work, you can keep your work projects in view while your personal projects are hidden and vice versa.

### Next Actions:
- Tasks with a clear, concrete action you will do the next chance you get.
	- ex: 'Email Jack the budget for the office party'
- Identify the next action for each project by [tagging it with the label](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195042-Labels?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) "@next".  To add a label, simply type "@" into the task field and start typing the task name.

### Tasks with a due date and/or time

For items that must be completed at a specific date and/or time, [schedule them](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205325931?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides). 
>[!Warning] But be warned: GTD cautions against over-reliance on due dates. Only add them to the tasks that really have to be done on a given date and time. For everything else, trust your next actions and a regular weekly review of all your task lists.


>[!TIp] 
>Sync your [Todoist with Google Calendar](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115003128085?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) so that calendar events appear in Todoist as tasks and scheduled Todoist tasks appear in your Google Calendar as events.

### Agendas

Some of the items you capture in your inbox will be reminders of things you want to bring up with someone else rather than next actions. To keep track of these agenda items:
#### How to implement in todoist:
-   Create a new project called _Agendas._
-   Create a new sub-project underneath _Agendas_ for each person you need to touch base with on a regular basis. For example, your boss and any direct reports. You may also want to create sub-projects for each regular team or project meeting you have. For example, _Marketing Weekly_.
-   Add the items you need to bring up as tasks in the relevant agenda sub-project.
-   When you meet with that person or come to the meeting, pull up the relevant project to see a list of all of the items you need to cover.
-   (Optional) [Share your agenda projects](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195062?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) with the relevant people so everyone can see, add, and even assign items to discuss.![GTD Agenda](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/497eVXkrC47ujlF42gA96F/f9353acc5cac047075b3efe2b389ce49/Agenda.png)

### Reference materials

- Reference materials are non-actionable items that you need to save (e.g., tax documents, reading material, spreadsheets, Word docs, phone numbers, etc). 
- While they aren't tasks themselves, they’re often needed to complete a task later. 
- You can organize these kinds of supporting reference materials in Todoist by attaching them to the relevant task or project comments:

-   Task-specific reference materials can be attached to the relevant task's comments.

![GTD Reference Materials Task Comments](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/6h86lb9m0YX2Apg7FlsLyL/ab352c0a1c24f35af5cde4dee07b00d4/GTD_Reference_Materials_Task_Comments.png)

-   Higher-level project materials (design specs, drafts, shared folders) can be attached or linked to in the project comments.
- ![GTD Project Comments](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/1bWdwePStxAlHRE1wgheuY/fac350a6626e388317a722e3cfadc0f4/Project_Comments.png)
- This way, when you're ready to start the task or project, you'll have all of the information you need close at hand.
- 
You'll likely also have reference materials that aren't associated with a specific task or project. For example:
	an article you saved from the web for later, 
	a file with important information, 
	or a gift idea for your partner's next birthday. 

#### How to implement in todoist:
-   Create a new _Reference_ project

-   Create new sub-projects underneath the _Reference_ project for each type of reference list. For example, _Gift Ideas_, _Birthdays_, _Contact Information,_ _Recipes_, etc.

-   Move your reference material tasks to the appropriate project by dragging and dropping them from your Inbox. Or select a new project via Quick Add by clicking to edit the task and typing "#" into the task field followed by the project name.

-   To collapse your reference sub-projects, click on the grey arrow to the left of your _Reference_ parent project. This helps remove visual clutter from your list.![Reference Projects](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/4iztZ5pHKSH1vpHvBRtsc3/ffe86e14a24220f33e055c7d961d3d1b/Reference_Projects.png)

### Waiting for:
These are items that have been delegated or are awaiting action by someone else.
#### How to implement in todoist:
Identify these tasks by tagging them with the label "@waiting_for". 
Keep @waiting_for tasks organized inside the projects their related to, or inside the _One-Off Tasks_ project if they're unrelated to other tasks.

### Someday/maybe:

- Many items that you capture will be ideas for things you want to do in the future, but don't have the bandwidth to work on now 
	- (e.g. places you may want to travel, books to read, new projects you may want to try, ideas for blog posts, etc.). 
You want to be able to review these later, but you don't want them gumming up your system now.

#### How to implement in todoist:
-   Create a new _Someday/Maybe_ project

-   Add all of the tasks and/or you want to do in the future, but aren't actively working on there

-   (Optional) Add sub-projects for specific types of "Someday/Maybe" tasks. For example, you may want to separate _Someday/Maybe — Personal_ and _Someday/Maybe — Work_ projects

-   Review your someday/maybe projects when time and energy open up to take on new work![GTD Someday Maybe Project](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/xbeYvXESKsW7G0qtCdM4E/ce549e5d320b323701604cd102ef25a5/Someday_Maybe_Project.png)

### Tasks that can be delegated

If you can delegate a task to free up your own time and energy, you should. In Todoist you can [share projects with people](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195062?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides), assign them tasks with due dates, and collaborate in comments.


### Contexts

- contexts identify tools, places, or people that you require to complete a given task.
- contexts allow you to focus on what you can actually get completed given your current circumstances. 
	- Ex: if you are at your office, you don’t want to waste time sorting out all the next actions you have at home.

Following the project approach we laid out above, the easiest way to add contexts is with [labels](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195042?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides). 
GTD recommends the following contexts:
-   Computer/internet
    
-   Home
    
-   Office
    
-   Errands
    
-   Calls
    
-   Anywhere

#### context suggestions:
- Some people like to add an Email context so they can take care of all their emails at once. 
- Others add labels for the amount of time a task might take. 
	- For example, if you have just 15 minutes before your next meeting, it's helpful to be able to identify all the tasks you could do quickly with an @15_min label. 
-_For most people, it's more useful to create an "Offline" label rather than an "Internet" one for tasks you can do when you don't have an internet connection._

## Engage

- Here is where the time spent clarifying and organizing your tasks pays off. 
- Your system is now full of concrete, actionable items organized into logical categories, ready for you to jump in. 
- You’ll see that all of the labels, projects, and due dates added in the steps above help you quickly answer the question  “What should I be doing right now?” at any given moment.

The time spent clarifying and organizing your tasks means that when it's time to engage with work, you have fewer choices to make and fewer reference materials to find. To decide what to do next, you can see upcoming tasks with due date, sort tasks by label, or create filters to see your next actions based on context.

### Today and Upcoming views

When you're ready to sit down to work, click on Today in the left-hand navigation menu to see any tasks that you must complete today. Open [Upcoming](https://doist.com/blog/todoist-upcoming-view/?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) to see what's coming down the pipeline this week and any week in the future.![GTD Today view](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/45ZNxhyoeMW30AhjhWLwSL/c3d77fb83b1de2915761346870733b95/Today_view.png)

### View Next Actions and Contexts via label

To view a full list of next actions across all your projects, type "@next" into the Quick Find bar at the top of your Todoist.
![GTD Next Actions Context Labels](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/Zhek7JdNpJ4j8fRCZaLJN/3c3dce95eef8d2f16510818090c0cdd5/Next_Actions_Context_Labels.png)![GTD Next Label](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/5Da8bwAVww0BAr9KGM59o4/9415ac26e36dbccaf1969cba4d0a0a51/Next_Label.png)

### Create more custom task views with filters

The real GTD magic happens when you create your own custom task views in Todoist using [filters](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205248842?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides). Filters are essentially saved searches that sort your list with one click. You can use filters to search for tasks based on:

-   Due date
    
-   Label
    
-   Priority
    
-   Project
    
-   Date a task was created
    
-   Assignee
    
-   Keywords
    
-   Or a combination of some or all of the above
    
#### How to implement in todoist:
To set up a new filter, go to the Filter list at the bottom of your left-hand navigation menu (after Projects and Labels), then click _Add filter_ at the bottom of the list. Give your filter a name and add the search query you want to see.![GTD Next Actions Work Query](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/3liVDnzJn304lRS9vUgiUM/9c2f689e248fa4f17d17f4c6229ee553/Next_Actions_Work_Query.png)
![GTD Next Action Work Filter View](https://images.ctfassets.net/dm4oa8qtogq0/1TSP9hk51I0kCALkuKiqHC/d613feca44ff35fb0b180d87405c4b67/Next_Action_Work_Filter_View.png)

- For GTD, the most relevant labels will likely combine "@next_action" with an area of focus or a context. 
- ex: for next actions that can be finished at the office use the query "@next_action & @office".

## Review

Each week, set aside time to look over all your lists, organize your tasks and keep your system running smoothly. The review helps you adapt to changes, refocus your attention, identify next actions, and reflect on your workflow.

>[!info] David Allen has called this weekly review a "critical factor for success" because frequent review of your system will ensure that you aren’t just doing things, but that you are doing the right things.

#### How to implement in todoist:
- To get started, import [Todoist’s GTD Weekly Review template](https://todoist.com/templates/personal/gtd-weekly-review?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) into your projects list. 
	This template includes all of the steps you’ll need to complete your review each week. 
- Customize the template by adding [sub-tasks](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/206432369?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) or task comments to hold the lists of all your inboxes, your current areas of focus, or to track reflections on your week.
- Schedule your weekly review by setting up a [recurring](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/360000636289?itm_campaign=getting_things_done&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) date in any task field. 
	- Simply enter your date as natural language, like “every Sunday at 5pm,” and Todoist will automatically recognize and schedule it when you save the task.
> [!abstract]
> The weekly review is a powerful productivity ritual regardless of whether you GTD or not, so there is  a standalone guide for [how to run your weekly review](http://todoist.com/productivity-methods/weekly-review).

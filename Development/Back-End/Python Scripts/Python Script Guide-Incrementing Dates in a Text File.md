# We are going to take what we did before and modify it a bit to fit our use cases. 

1. **Read the File**:
   - Open the text file in read mode.
   - Read the contents of the file into a list of lines.

2. **Parse the Data**:
   - Iterate through the list of lines.
   - Use string manipulation methods to identify dates and values. You might find regular expressions useful for this if the dates follow a specific pattern.

3. **Increment Dates**:
   - Store the values and dates in a structured way (e.g., a list of tuples).
   - Increment the dates by one within each value. _This means the 2020-02-06 should become 2020-02-07._

4. **Reconstruct the Data**:
   - Combine the shifted dates and their corresponding values back into the original format.

5. **Write the Data Back**:
   - Open the text file in write mode (or a new file if you prefer).
   - Write the modified data back to the file.

Here are some details for each step:

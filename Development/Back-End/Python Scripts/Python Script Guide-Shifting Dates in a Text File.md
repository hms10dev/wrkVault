1. **Read the File**:
   - Open the text file in read mode.
   - Read the contents of the file into a list of lines.

2. **Parse the Data**:
   - Iterate through the list of lines.
   - Use string manipulation methods to identify dates and values. You might find regular expressions useful for this if the dates follow a specific pattern.

3. **Shift Dates**:
   - Store the values and dates in a structured way (e.g., a list of tuples).
   - Shift the dates to the left by one position within each value. This means the first date should become the last date after the shift.

4. **Reconstruct the Data**:
   - Combine the shifted dates and their corresponding values back into the original format.

5. **Write the Data Back**:
   - Open the text file in write mode (or a new file if you prefer).
   - Write the modified data back to the file.

Here are some details for each step:

### Step 1: Read the File
- Use `open()` with `'r'` mode.
- Read all lines using `readlines()` or iterate through the file line by line.

### Step 2: Parse the Data
- Regular expressions can be handy. For instance, if dates are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, a regex like `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` might be useful.
- Split each line to separate dates and values if they are structured in a predictable way (e.g., comma-separated).

### Step 3: Shift Dates
- Create a data structure to hold your dates and values. For example, a list of lists or a list of tuples.
- To shift elements in a list, you can use slicing. For instance, to shift `[1, 2, 3]` to `[2, 3, 1]`, you can use list slicing: `shifted_list = original_list[1:] + original_list[:1]`.

### Step 4: Reconstruct the Data
- After shifting, reformat the dates and values back into strings that match the original format.
- String concatenation or `join()` can help here.

### Step 5: Write the Data Back
- Use `open()` with `'w'` mode to write the data back to a file.
- Write each line back to the file using `writelines()` or a loop with `write()`.

Hereâ€™s a pseudo-code outline to help you visualize:

```python
# Step 1: Read the file
with open('input.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Step 2: Parse the data
parsed_data = []
for line in lines:
    # Extract dates and values
    # Example: Use regex or split the line
    dates = extract_dates(line)  # Placeholder function
    value = extract_value(line)  # Placeholder function
    parsed_data.append((dates, value))

# Step 3: Shift dates
for data in parsed_data:
    dates, value = data
    shifted_dates = dates[1:] + dates[:1]  # Shift dates
    data = (shifted_dates, value)

# Step 4: Reconstruct the data
modified_lines = []
for data in parsed_data:
    dates, value = data
    # Combine dates and value back into a string
    modified_line = format_line(dates, value)  # Placeholder function
    modified_lines.append(modified_line)

# Step 5: Write the data back
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in modified_lines:
        file.write(line)
```

By following these steps and filling in the placeholder functions (`extract_dates`, `extract_value`, `format_line`) with your specific logic, you should be able to create the script you need. Good luck!

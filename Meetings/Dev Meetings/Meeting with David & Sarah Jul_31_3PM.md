# Working Together for Better Outcomes

**Goal:** Identify systemic blockers and establish clearer processes so we can both succeed and deliver excellent work efficiently.

## What's Working Well

- I've been incorporating feedback promptly and professionally
- When I identify issues, I follow documented practices and consult senior engineers
- I'm putting in extra hours and weekend work to meet deadlines
- The review process has successfully caught mistakes when they occur

## Validation from Technical Leadership

I discussed these challenges with Sarah (our principal engineer) to validate my technical approach and get perspective on the framework difficulties. She confirmed that:

- The MUP framework is genuinely "finicky" with poor documentation
- The VM-to-local workflow naturally introduces error risk for everyone
- Telepresence and tooling failures are known issues affecting multiple team members
- Many engineers encounter similar blockers but don't speak up, which skews perception

This conversation helped clarify that the challenges I'm facing are systemic rather than individual competency issues.

## Where We Can Improve Together

### **Making Technical Discussions More Effective**

**Current challenge:** Troubleshooting conversations sometimes assume simple fixes when the underlying framework issues are complex.
- There is a lack of visibility when it comes to me troubleshooting devops issues. 

**What would help:** When I've consulted senior engineers and followed documented practices, could we start from the assumption that there may be genuine technical complexity? This would help me think more clearly and troubleshoot faster.
- I will also start looping you in whenever I do reach out for assistance so it is clearer to folks to address things quicker


### **Clarifying Support Pathways**

**Current challenge:** While Sarah has been helpful as a technical resource, she has lead engineer duties and doesn't have full context on Forecasting work, which can leave me stuck when she's unavailable.

**What would help:** Could we identify a dedicated "Forecasting buddy" - someone with domain knowledge who could be my go-to for quick questions and blockers? This would give me reliable support without overwhelming Sarah and would prevent late-night spinning on issues.

### **Understanding Workflow Complexity**

**Current challenge:** The VM-to-local workflow for MUP changes requires careful manual coordination across multiple environments, which adds hidden complexity to what might appear straightforward.

**What would help:** When we discuss timelines or mistakes, could we factor in that some tasks involve multi-step workflows that aren't immediately visible? This context would help set more realistic expectations.

### **Streamlining the Review Process**

**Current challenge:** PR feedback often comes in multiple stages over several days, which extends story lifecycles. PR comments combined with 2-hour CI/CD builds create artificial delays, even for minor changes.

**What would help:** Could we establish dedicated PR review time - perhaps 15 minutes after scrum calls or quick walkthrough sessions where I can explain my changes and reasoning in real-time? This would allow for consolidated feedback and faster resolution. I'm happy to take the lead on scheduling these to make the process smoother for everyone.

**What would help:** Could we establish core review hours or batch smaller feedback? This would help both of us use time more efficiently.
- Even being placed as a reviewer on Other people's PRs could help me gain insight into best practices and practice spotting small mistakes so that way I can be more diligent about when giving my own PR's a once over(draft -> Once over -> then send to you guys -> then approvals )


## What I'm Committed To

- Continuing to deliver high-quality work and learn from mistakes
- Being proactive about communicating blockers early
- Following up promptly on feedback and maintaining professionalism
- Putting in the effort needed while also flagging systemic inefficiencies

## What Success Looks Like

**For both of us:**

- Faster story completion with fewer back-and-forth cycles
- Clear expectations about complexity and realistic timelines
- Efficient use of everyone's time and energy
- Psychological safety that encourages good problem-solving

**Questions for discussion:**

1. What would you need from me to make the review process more efficient?
2. Are there framework limitations I should document to help set better expectations?
3. How can we build in more predictable support when I hit genuine technical blockers?
4. What's the best way to communicate when I'm working extra hours so you have visibility into effort level?

I'm excited to work together on making our collaboration even more effective. What feels most important to tackle first?

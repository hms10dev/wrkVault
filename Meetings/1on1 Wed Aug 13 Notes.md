# Meeting Notes - Framework Focus & Sprint Planning

## Key Decisions & Action Items

### Sprint Goals

- **Target:** 5-6 story points this sprint (moving toward 6 as standard)
- **Strategy:** Focus on framework/UI stories vs. complex business logic
- **Timeline:** Code freeze Tuesday/Wednesday, planning Thursday/Friday

### Current Sprint Work

- ‚úÖ Auto aggregate story - DONE
- ‚úÖ Quick defect fix - DONE
- üîÑ Lifecycle status research - waiting on Abolash backend changes
- üìù Percent field change - new easy story to boost stats

### New Meeting Structure

**Friday Office Hours** (replacing daily check-ins)

- Weekly sprint planning & story review
- Technical discussion time
- Flexible timing (closer to lunch/afternoon)
- Include DA if needed

**Presentation Dry Run**

- Scheduled for next Friday
- Include: David, Hollis, Achea
- Goal: Final feedback before presentation

## Strategic Shift: Framework Focus

### Why This Change

- More available resources & documentation for framework/UI
- Less dependency on limited business logic experts
- Easier to achieve story point targets while learning
- Reduces pressure while still building domain knowledge

### What This Means

- **Primary focus:** Framework, UI, entity creation, async operations
- **Secondary learning:** Business logic through observation & discussion
- **Knowledge building:** Understanding backend changes without implementation pressure

## Lifecycle Status Deep Dive

### Business Context

**What it is:** Tracks where items are in their lifecycle (new ‚Üí active ‚Üí discontinued)

- Standard statuses: Active, Inactive, Discontinued
- Each status has ~10-15 boolean flags (should forecast, should order, etc.)
- Critical for forecasting decisions

### Technical Implementation

**Inheritance Challenge:**

- Status can be set at global, region, class, item, or item location level
- Item locations inherit from higher levels
- 16M item locations vs 300K items = performance considerations
- Status fetched "on the fly" rather than stored at item location level

**Current Process:**

1. Forecasting runs ‚Üí fetches lifecycle status from item location
2. Status saved on forecast entity
3. Only updates when forecasting runs again
4. Status reflects "last time forecasting system checked" not real-time

### Your Work

- Abolash: Backend changes to fetch/display lifecycle status
- Hollis: UI implementation to show status on forecast entity list
- **Learning opportunity:** Review Abolash's code, understand inheritance framework

## Career Development Plan

### Learning Strategy

1. **Hands-on:** Framework/UI stories for consistent delivery
2. **Observation:** Review backend changes, ask for code walkthroughs
3. **Documentation:** Log business logic learning in residency training
4. **Discussion:** Friday sessions for deeper technical understanding

### Success Metrics

- Consistent 5-6 story point delivery
- Growing framework expertise
- Business domain knowledge through osmosis
- Proactive story ownership & closure

### Tools & Process

- Continue using Obsidian for notes
- Use spaced repetition plugins for review
- Set calendar reminders for sprint planning
- Own story closure process (chase testing, QE, etc.)

# First Follow-up 1:1 Preparation

## Opening Approach

**Keep it brief and positive.** Don't rehash the systemic issues unless he brings them up. Focus on moving forward and demonstrating the feedback you took from the last meeting.

## Work Updates to Lead With

### **Completed Deliverables:**

- ✅ AI-38817 merged and approved
- ✅ AI-39725 merged and approved
- Both stories delivered as committed

### **Current Work:**

- Working on AI-20833 (Lifecycle Status hardcoding identification)
- Making good progress on the research phase
- Planning dry run for Elasticsearch presentation (seeking feedback timing)

## Key Messages to Convey

### **1. Taking Accountability (Show, Don't Tell):**

- "I've been focusing on the upfront analysis you mentioned - spending more time understanding requirements before jumping into implementation"
- "I'm being more systematic about documenting my approach on the lifecycle status research"

### **2. Process Improvements I'm Implementing:**

- Earlier communication when blockers arise
- More detailed upfront planning on stories
- Keeping better developer logs of what takes time

### **3. Proactive Communication:**

- "I wanted to check if the delivery pace on those two stories felt more aligned with expectations"
- "For the Elasticsearch presentation - should I schedule the dry run for next week, or would you prefer a different timeline?"

## Questions to Ask

### **Forward-Looking:**

1. "How did the delivery timing feel on AI-38817 and AI-39725?"
2. "Any specific areas you'd like me to focus on for the lifecycle status research?"
3. "What's the best way to keep you updated on progress for longer research tasks like this one?"

### **Process-Oriented:**

1. "Should I schedule time for the Elasticsearch presentation dry run this week?"
2. "Any team members you'd recommend I sync with on the lifecycle status findings?"

## What NOT to Bring Up

- Don't mention the systemic issues unless he does
- Don't reference the previous meeting's dynamics
- Don't ask about process changes or support structure
- Don't bring up the "too verbose" feedback unless directly relevant

## If He Brings Up Previous Meeting

**Stay professional and forward-focused:**

- "I appreciate the feedback from our last conversation. I've been implementing the suggestions around upfront planning and delivery consistency."
- "The regular check-ins have been helpful for staying aligned."

## Notes Strategy

**Document everything he says, especially:**

- Any feedback on delivery pace
- Guidance on current work priorities
- Timeline expectations for ongoing tasks
- Any mention of team dynamics or communication

## Mindset Going In

- This is about demonstrating you heard his feedback and are acting on it
- Keep it collaborative and solution-focused
- Show progress through actions, not discussions about process
- Stay calm if he brings up previous concerns - respond with concrete examples of changes you've made

---

**Bottom line:** Lead with accomplishments, show you're implementing his feedback through actions, and keep the focus on current/future work rather than past process discussions.

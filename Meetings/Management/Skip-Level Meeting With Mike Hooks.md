## Questions:

1. Are there any supplementary meetings or forums where I can actively participate to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the design process of the SCP product? I'm eager to delve deeper and broaden my knowledge.

2. In order to maximize my contribution during this phase of ramping up for the front ends, would it be beneficial for me to explore opportunities to make meaningful contributions to the backend in the interim? I want to ensure I'm adding value to the overall project.

3. Throughout your successful career, have you adhered to any specific philosophies or principles that have played a significant role in your achievements? I'm keen to learn from your experiences and apply them to my own professional journey.

4. How did you personally define success early in your career? What specific metrics or criteria did you utilize to gauge your progress and accomplishments? I'm interested in understanding your perspective on measuring success and how it evolved over time.

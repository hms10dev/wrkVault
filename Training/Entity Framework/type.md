Translated to¬†LocalDateTime¬†in Java, stored as Timestamp in the DB. mySQL does not support date beyond Jan 18th 2038 for data type timestamp, it is recommended to use dataType "dateTime" for all the records beyond Jan 18th 2038 (We cannot modify data type from timeStamp to dateTime and vice versa, it is recommended that a new dateTime data type is created to store date beyond Jan 18th 2038. _Example: 2015-10-28T10:15:30 (ISO Date Time Format)_ |
| quantity     |       | This is a compound datatype made up of a decimal field for the¬†**quantity**¬†value and a tinyText to store the¬†**unit of measure**. Use this instead of pairs of qty and uom fields in the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| dimension    |       | This is a compound datatype made up of 3 decimal fields for¬†**height**,¬†**width**¬†and¬†**length**, and a tinyText to store the common¬†**unit of measure**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| uom          |       | This is a base Dynamic Enumeration used to represent¬†**unit of measure**¬†values (besides the quantity and dimension datatypes.) When using this for a property type, you must set dynaEnum=‚Äùtrue‚Äù for the property                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This data type was introduced in version 0.0.2 of the entity framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

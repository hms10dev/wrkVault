## What is a container?

- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
- carporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore.
- "Lorem ipsum dolor sit quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur?
 1. quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi:
    1. ut labore et dolore 
    magnam aliquam quaerat
    voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam


## Container Vs. Virtual Machine
- ![[Screen Shot 2022-08-25 at 2.55.49 PM.png]]
- Containers are faster, and less isolation
- VMs can have different apps on different OS'

## Container _and_ virtual machines
- ![[Screen Shot 2022-08-25 at 2.56.50 PM.png]]
- most times its like this

## Container vs Image
Image
- package or template, used to create one or more containers.

Containers
- running instances of Images, and have their own environments and resources







## Subject 3

- study of graphs began in 17366, Leonhard Euler's Sever Bridges of Konisberg
    - study: find a path that would cross every bridge only once
    - no such path could be found

### SubSubject

- four-color theorem
- GPS/maps

### SubSubject 2

- Social networks, such as facebook, twitter, and instagram
- gene/protein expression networks

## Equation Example:

$$
G = (V,E)
$$

- n vertices V ((nodes))
- m edges E (links)
- all elements are unique, aka **no repeated values**
- each edge is defined by its starting and ending edges.
    - ex: (a,b)

# REVIEW :

# Vocab:

- **undirected** graph
    
    $e =(u,v)∈ E ⇒ (v,u)∈ E$
    
    in other words, its possible to go from u to v, and vice versa
    
- **directed** graph
    
    it is not possible to go from u to v and vice versa
    
    so the 
    
    $e =(u,v)∈ E ⇒ (v,u)∈ E$
    
    equation does not hold..
    
- self loop
    
    the starting and ending vertices are the same 
    
    i.e. e=(v,v))
    
- path
    
    A path is a sequence of vertices (v1,v2,...,vk), such that vi+1 is a neighbor of vi .
